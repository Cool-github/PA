14. How are Goods and Services 
Classified under GST for the Purpose of 
Taxation?
 The Goods and Services Tax GST is a uniform indirect tax system introduced 
in India to replace multiple earlier taxes such as VAT, Service Tax, Excise Duty, 
etc. GST follows the principle of “One Nation, One Taxˮ, aiming to create a 
common national market and remove the cascading effect of taxes. It is levied 
on the supply of goods and services at every stage of the value chain but 
allows Input Tax Credit ITC, which ensures that tax is ultimately borne only by 
the final consumer.
 To determine how much GST is to be paid, goods and services are classified 
into various categories and tax slabs.
 Classification of Goods under GST
 Goods under GST are classified based on usage, durability, and purpose. The 
major classifications are:
 1. Consumer Goods
 These are goods purchased by individuals for personal use.
 Examples: Clothing, packaged foods, footwear, soaps.
 2. Capital Goods
 These are goods used in the production of other goods.
 Examples: Machinery, tools, manufacturing equipment.
 3. Durable Goods
 Goods that can be used repeatedly over a long period.
 Examples: Refrigerator, washing machine, furniture, mobile phones.
 4. Non-Durable Goods
 Goods that are consumed quickly and have a short life.
 Examples: Biscuits, medicines, milk, fruits.

Classification of Services under GST
 Services include activities such as:
 Banking Services
 Hotel and Restaurant Services
 Education and Training Services
 Telecom Services
 Healthcare and Consultancy Services
 Services are also placed under GST tax slabs similar to goods.
 GST Tax Slab Structure
 To ensure fairness and affordability, GST is divided into five major tax slabs:
 GST Rate Nature of Goods/Services Examples
 0% Essential and unprocessed
 goods
 Fresh vegetables, milk, grains,
 healthcare services
 5% Essential items of common
 consumption
 Rail tickets, life-saving drugs, tea,
 edible oil
 12% Standard or processed goods Packed foods, mobile phones,
 financial services
 18% Most widely used standard
 goods
 ACs, laptops, branded garments,
 restaurant services
 28% Luxury or sin goods Luxury cars, aerated drinks, tobacco
 products
 Types of GST Under the Dual GST Model
 India follows a dual GST structure:
 Tax Type Applied On Example
 CGST Central GST Within the same
 state
 On purchase within Telangana: CGST 
 SGST applies
 SGST State GST Within the same
 state Revenue shared with state government
 IGST Integrated
 GST
 Interstate
 transactions Purchase from Maharashtra to Telangana
 PPLE 4
This system ensures both the Central and State governments receive fair 
revenue.
 Benefits of GST Classification
  Uniformity in taxation across the country.
  Transparency in the tax structure.
  Removes cascading effect due to Input Tax Credit.
  Boosts business ease and trade efficiency.
  Reduces corruption and tax evasion due to online monitoring.
 Example to Understand GST in Daily Life
 If you buy a mobile phone:
 It falls under 12% GST
 Price ₹10,000  GST  ₹1,200  Final Price  ₹11,200
 If you eat at an AC restaurant:
 Service falls under 18% GST
 This classification makes the taxation system clear and predictable.
 Conclusion
 The classification of goods and services under GST ensures that the tax 
system is structured, fair, and progressive. By placing essential goods in low 
tax slabs and luxury/sin goods in higher tax slabs, GST promotes economic 
justice. It simplifies the indirect tax environment, reduces tax burden on the 
common man, encourages compliance, and strengthens the Indian market as a 
unified economy.
 15. Discharge of Contract – Meaning and Various 
Modes of Discharge
 A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that 
creates enforceable rights and obligations. However, the obligations under a 
contract are not meant to last forever. When the rights and duties created by a 
PPLE
 5
contract come to an end, the contract is said to be discharged. In simple 
words, discharge of contract means the termination of the contractual 
relationship between the parties, releasing them from further performance.
 Meaning
 Discharge of contract refers to the point where the contract ceases to have 
legal effect and the parties are freed from their contractual obligations. After 
discharge, no party can sue the other based on the terms of the original 
contract.
 Modes of Discharge of Contract
 There are several ways in which a contract may be discharged:
 1. Discharge by Performance
 This is the most common and natural mode of discharge. When both parties 
fulfill their obligations as agreed in the contract, the contract is said to be 
discharged by performance.
 Actual Performance: Performance completed fully.
 Attempted Performance Tender): One party offers to perform but the 
other refuses; the contract may still be treated as discharged on the 
offering partyʼs part.
 Example: A agrees to supply 50 chairs to B for ₹5,000. A delivers, and B pays. 
The contract is complete.
 2. Discharge by Mutual Agreement
 Since a contract is created by agreement, it can also be ended by mutual 
agreement. Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act allows parties to change, 
cancel or replace contracts.
 Forms include:
 Method
 Novation
 Rescission
 Alteration
 Meaning
 A new contract replaces the old one.
 Both parties agree to cancel the contract.
 Terms of the existing contract are changed.
 PPLE

Method
 Meaning
 Remission
 Waiver
 Promisee accepts lesser performance than what was agreed.
 One party voluntarily gives up its right under the contract.
 Example: If A owes B ₹5,000, but B accepts ₹3,000 as full payment, the 
contract is discharged by remission.
 3. Discharge by Breach of Contract
 When a party fails to perform their part of the contract intentionally or 
negligently, there is a breach. The innocent party has the right to:
 Treat the contract as terminated, and
 Claim damages.
 Breach may be:
 Actual Breach: Failure to perform on the due date.
 Anticipatory Breach: One party declares their intention not to perform 
before the performance date.
 Example: A agrees to deliver goods on 10th Jan but refuses on 5th Jan → 
anticipatory breach.
 4. Discharge by Impossibility or Frustration
 A contract may become impossible to perform due to events beyond the 
control of the parties. When performance becomes physically or legally 
impossible, the contract is discharged.
 Causes of impossibility:
 Death of a person required personally to perform contract
 Change in law
 Destruction of subject matter
 War, flood, earthquake, pandemic, etc.
 Example: If a music singer becomes permanently ill and cannot perform a 
concert, the contract is discharged.
 5. Discharge by Operation of Law
 PPLE
 7
A contract may be discharged automatically under certain legal conditions:
 Insolvency of a party
 Merger of rights (lower right merges with higher right)
 Unauthorized material alteration of contract
 Death of a party (in personal skill contracts)
 Conclusion
 Discharge of contract is essential to bring finality to the contractual 
relationship. It ensures that once obligations have been fulfilled, or when 
unforeseen circumstances arise, the law provides appropriate closure and 
remedies to the parties involved.
 16. Patents – Meaning and Patentable Inventions 
under Indian Law
 Meaning of Patent
 A Patent is an exclusive legal right granted by the government to an inventor 
for a new invention. It allows the inventor exclusive control over making, using, 
and selling the invention for a specific period, generally 20 years. After the 
term ends, the invention enters the public domain.
 Patents encourage innovation, scientific research, and technological 
progress, since inventors get recognition and financial benefit for their 
discoveries.
 Objectives of Patent System
 To promote creativity and innovation
 To reward inventors with exclusive rights
 To encourage disclosure of inventions to society
 To prevent unauthorized commercial use of inventions
